              The course is designed to be part-time! It is developed keeping
              working professionals and undergraduates in mind. You'll have
              daily live lectures by our instructors from 8 pm to 11 pm and
              you'll need to put in 2-3 hours of self-study time for our
              Beginner Course & 5-7 hours for our Intermediate Course to solve
              assignments. On weekends you'll also have coding contests, soft
              skills training, mentor sessions and mock interviews. Nothing in
              the course will stop you from joining your college classes or
              attending your office.
